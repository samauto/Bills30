    <H2>We at Bills of Health LLC believe that everyone should have healthcare insurance.</H2>
    Yet as the landscape of healthcare changes and with the cost of healthcare rising, we at Bills of Health donâ€™t believe that using your healthcare insurance is always the smartest and cheapest way to go.<BR>
    As a trend individuals are now choosing plans with lower premiums with higher deductibles.<BR> 
    As the cost of healthcare insurance grows, the pool of medical providers that accept certain insurances shrinks.<BR>
    We at Bills of Health are here to give the public another option. We believe that by paying by cash. or credit card upfront, you should be able to get a discounted price while seeing a healthcare provider of your choice.<BR>
    Not worrying if the provider is in network, out of network, or if they are even covered by your insurance plan.<BR>
    For most consumers this route will let you see the provider you want for a cheaper cost.<BR>
    You would save money, just by avoiding the upcharge of the insurance company to meet your deductible.
